# Auto Cat Photo Capture for Raspberry Pi

Cat detection and auto photo capture using the Raspberry Pi AI Camera (Sony IMX500) On-sensor inference.  Can save full frame or rectangular or square crops of the cat with optional live preview.

## ‚ú® Key features

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **On-chip inference** | Uses the IMX500‚Äôs built-in MobileNet-SSD COCO model for real-time detection. |
| **Live preview** | Previe wwindow at 640√ó480; disable with `--no-preview`. |
| **High-resolution full frame or crops** | Switches to full-sensor mode in a background thread; saves:<br>‚Ä¢ `cat_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg` |
| **Rate limiting** | Configurable delay between captures (s)|
| **Config toggles** | Threshold, margin, crop size, save interval, save folder are one-line constants at the top. |
| **Thread-safe** | Detection and high-res capture happen in separate threads so inference is never blocked. |

## üñ•Ô∏è Tested hardware & OS

* Raspberry Pi 5 (4+ GB) w/Raspberry Pi OS
* Raspberry Pi AI Camera 
* Python 3.11 + Picamera2 ‚â• 0.3

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

| Package | Version (tested) |
|---------|------------------|
| `python3-picamera2` | 0.3.15 |
| `python3-opencv`    | 4.10.* |
| `python3-pil` (Pillow) | 10.* |
| `numpy`             | 1.26.* |
| `imx500-all` & `imx500-tools` | (latest) |

Install any missing Python deps with:

```
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 python3-opencv python3-pil
```

## ü§ñ Neural-network model

* Model: MobileNet-SSD (COCO, 320 √ó 320)
* Class ID for cat: 17
* Blob path: /usr/share/imx500-models/imx500_network_ssd_mobilenetv2_fpnlite_320x320_pp.rpk

## üìÇ Where photos are saved

By default the script saves into a folder photos/ next to the script file:
```
SCRIPT_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
SAVE_DIR   = SCRIPT_DIR / "photos"
```
One JPEGs are written per detection. Quality is set to 92. The folder is auto-created on first run.

---

## üöÄ Usage
```
# Default: preview ON, square
python3 capture_cats.py

# Headless capture (no OpenCV window)
python3 capture_cats.py --no-preview

# Headless capture (no OpenCV window)
python3 capture_cats.py --capture {square|crop|full} 
```

Command-line flags


| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--preview`     | Show live OpenCV window (default). |
| `--no-preview`  | Disable window; quit with **Ctrl-C**. |
| `--capture {square|crop|full}` | Change capture format |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tunable constants (top of file)

| Constant | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CONF_THRESHOLD`   | `0.60` | Detection confidence threshold |
| `MIN_INTERVAL_SEC` | `10`   | Minimum seconds between saves |
| `MARGIN_RATIO`     | `0.20` | 10 % margin around bbox (0.20 = ¬±10 %) |
| `CROP_SIZE`        | `1024` | Square crop side length |
| `SAVE_DIR`         | see above | Folder for saved images |
